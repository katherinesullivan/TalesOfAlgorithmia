                Thomas Hanks never sleeps, he has dedicated each and every minute of his days to KarpTrans his railway cargo company. This night he isn't sleeping either, but not because of his work. This night is different and will turn even more different when Edmond arrives.

However, we will not dig up on that so soon, first we should start from the beginning.

October. Fourth month in which KarpTrans hasn't made enough to even cover up its employees' salaries. Hanks as could be predicted is devastated. He has tried everything, his head has been going through everything and he has tried everything: their prices could get not higher and they would accept anyone as a client. The latter being the reason why three months prior he had met Edmond, owner of a cellphone company, whose products were now being transported by KarpTruck.

Edmond was a man of maths as Thomas would call him. He always had some riddle to share, some knowledge they would both enjoy. And that's how the two of them became good friends. 

Nevertheless, the time they spent together was getting shorter and shorter as the KarpTrans's finanaces kept worsening. And it is little to say Edmond was not happy with this. He struggled to make friends and having Thomas by his side really made him thank existance.

So, this brings us to a morning in October where they are both sitting at a café. Thomas is just going on and on about how he's gonna lose it all when Edmond interrupted him and in his most serious voice said

-You are going to do the following and don't doubt when I say this is the best option you have. You are going to study each route your trains go through, you are going to know what's the maximung cargo capacity they could be holding and then you are going to locate boms so as to ensure that not even one good might make it from its source to its destination. However, I really need you to take this seriously you have to study beforehand in order to know how to place the minimum amount of bombs thus having the minimum chance of getting caught. Then you will be able to cash in money from the insurance company and something more that I'm not going to reveal to you until this is done. But you have to trust me. Do as I say.

And without letting out another word Edmond stood up and left the café, leaving a very disorientated Thomas behind. 

Hanks thought it through a lot, he didn't want to sabotage his own company but it really seemed like an easy way to cash in a good amount of money and get some time to decide what to do with the falling company that didn't stop produciong losses. He had devised a plan with the requeriments Edmond stated.

And this takes us to the night where this story started. Thomas isn't sleeping because tomorrow he is going to execute the plan. He is going to bomb his own trains. He is nervous but nothing compared to what he will feel the moment someone rings the doorbell.

At this point Hanks is sure it is the police, that they had found out what he was going to do and arrest him. Nothing further from the truth. When he came to his senses Hanks checked who was at his door and Edmond was just standing smiling holding some papers.

After he let him in the first two questions Hanks made were quite predictable a "what are you doing here?" followed by a "what are those papers?". The way Edmond responded, on the other hand, wasn't thet predictable. He just smiled and hand the papers over.

In the front page it read Max-flow min-cut theorem. Its thesis stated the maximum value of an s-t flow is equal to the minimum capacity over all s-t cuts.

Hanks could not get hold of it so he just asked Hanks againg what was all this. And so he started explaining.

Edmond began by translating the thesis by saying that it stated that the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the smallest total weight of the edges which if removed would disconnect the source from the sink. He then asked Thomas what he had asked him to do

-To bomb my company -he simply said.

-Well that's true but not all I said. I told you to find a way to put the least amount of possible bombs in order to ensure that not even one good makes it from its source to its destination. That's your min-cut. You, because I know you did what I asked, have found the min-cut and can therefore know its capacity and thus knowing the  maximum flow we can get. That's why I wanted you to do this. -Edmond then replied.

-And with the help of the misters Ford and Fulkerson and their algorithm which is in this paper explained we are going to be able to devise a maximum flow for your company, which is to say a way to maximize the goods your transport whilst using the same amount of trains and trips. Tomorrow you are not going to bomb your company, you are going to make the most out of it - he followed.

The smile in Hanks' face said it all.

And even though Edmond made it hard for him with all the suspense and not getting straight to the point he promises you he will be direct while sharing information about the history of this mathematical findings and the greedy algorithm that inspired Ford-Fulkerson as well as the paper in Edmonds hands and how Edmonds and Karp made an even more interesting algorithm that Ford-Fulkerson's one. All of this in the further reading section.
